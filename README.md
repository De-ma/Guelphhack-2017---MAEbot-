# Guelphhack-2017 MAEbot
Attended a 2 day hackathon and this was the final product that my team and I created. 


The theme was mental health, so we created a messenger bot that is AI like that talks to you and checks up on you from time to time. In addition it provides you with resources like if you would like to contact a service called good2Talk or even just access their website. My team ended up winning second place in this hackathon!
